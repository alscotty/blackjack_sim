Getting started -
Goal to create a blackjack game - all html/react so I can later use Serenade AI to practice with voice commands only! Ex. say "Hit" or "Stand" to play the game
Practice for myself on the Ten Count Strategy, founded by Ed Thorp, a genius mathmetician, blackjack player, and hedge fund manager on Wall Street

Goals
- blackjack core gameplay []
    - doubling down allowed [x]
    - pair splitting allowed []
- player can modify # of decks []
- displays running count, # unseen "others" vs # unseen 10's for Ten Count Strategy [x]
- add test cases []
